const PromptPrefix = `You are a Model United Nations (MUN) chair. Below, you are provided with a list of delegates along with their respective scores for different evaluation parameters.

Each delegate has:
- A name (shown as "Delegate Name:")
- A set of scores formatted as "Parameter: received / highest", where:
  - "received" is the score this delegate earned
  - "highest" is the highest score achieved in that parameter across the committee

Your task is to write a single-paragraph feedback for each delegate. The feedback should:
- Refer to the delegate by their name (e.g., "John performed well in...")
- Critically analyze their strengths and weaknesses based on each parameter
- Be constructive, insightful, and based solely on the scores provided
- Avoid repetition and generic praise
`

const PromptSuffix = `Your output must strictly follow this format for each delegate:

Delegate Name: <Name>
Feedback: <One-paragraph feedback>

Use two newlines between feedback entries. Do not add any extra comments, introductions, or summariesâ€”only the feedback blocks as specified.`
